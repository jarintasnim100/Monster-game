//	A MyBattle class that implements interface Battle and has attributes player 
//	and monster. There is a run() method that let player and monster battle against 
//	each other until one of them dies. In each player turn, the method displays player 
//	hitPoints and monster hitPoints, then attack or heal following playerâ€™s command, 
//	and checks if monster is killed. In each monster turn, the method checks 
//	if the monster is going to enrage, then let the monster attack the player 
//	and checks if player is killed.5
